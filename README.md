# 🎨 AI-Powered Poster Generator with Perfect Text Placement

This project aims to develop an **AI model** that generates visually appealing images, such as movie posters, with unstructured, colorful, and contextually appropriate **visual text placement**. Unlike current models, which struggle with issues like incorrect text placement or spelling errors, our trained model will focus on learning **precise text placement and styling** by leveraging advanced AI techniques and a robust training dataset.

---

## 🚀 Motivation

Despite advancements in AI image generation, there are currently **no large language models (LLMs)** or image-generation models capable of achieving perfect text placement in images like movie posters. Existing models often:
- Make **mistakes in text placement**, leading to poor visual aesthetics.
- Introduce **spelling or formatting errors** in the text.  

Our project tackles these challenges by combining **state-of-the-art AI models** and a carefully curated training pipeline to develop a model that excels in:
1. Generating high-quality images.
2. Accurately placing text in unstructured, visually appealing ways.
3. Maintaining spelling and stylistic integrity.

## ⚙️ Approach

### 1. **🎥 Image Generation**
We use the **[black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)** model for **image generation**. This serves as the foundation for creating visually stunning movie poster-like images.

### 2. **🔧 Conditional Image Control**
To control the image parameters (such as Resolution, Strength, DDIM sampling, seed, etc.), we use the **[lllyasviel/ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet)** framework. ControlNet ensures that the AI understands the layout constraints required for text placement.

### 3. **🛠️ Data Collection and Preprocessing**
We curated our dataset using the following steps:
- **Data Collection**: Extracted thousands of movie poster images from various sources using techniques like direct search and web scraping.
- **Captions Generation**: Captions were automatically generated for each image using the **[vikhyatk/moondream2](https://huggingface.co/vikhyatk/moondream2)** model, which provided detailed descriptions of the posters.
- **Conditional Images**: We generated lineart-style conditional images for each poster using the **[lllyasviel/Annotators](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet/blob/main/annotator/README.md)** model. These conditional images will play a key role during training by guiding the AI on text placement.

### 4. **🧠 Model Training(later)**
Our AI model will:
- Learn to generate images using the **FLUX.1-dev** model.
- Learn text placement from the conditional lineart images and captions.
- Optimize visual text styling and accuracy through advanced training techniques.

## 📈 Current Progress

So far, we have:
1. Extracted a large dataset of movie posters.
2. Generated detailed captions for each poster using **moondream2**.
3. Created lineart-style conditional images using **lllyasviel/Annotators**.

### Dataset Structure:
| **🖼️ Image**         | **✍️ Caption**                                                                 | **🖊️ Conditional Image**      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Movie poster image    | A description of the poster, including characters, text, colors, etc.      | Lineart representation        |

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. Train the model on the curated dataset to learn accurate text placement and styling.
2. Fine-tune the AI to ensure it handles unstructured text formats with high precision.
3. Optimize the AI for generating movie-poster-like images based on user-defined prompts.
