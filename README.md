# üé® AI-Powered Poster Generator

We've designed a machine learning model capable of generating images that **accurately incorporate specified text or lettering within the image**. Existing image-generation models often struggle with proper text placement, either misplacing the text or introducing spelling errors. Our goal is to train the model to master the art of **placing text accurately and aesthetically within generated images**. This innovation enables the seamless creation of visually appealing outputs such as **poster designs** and **template fills**, all from a single prompt.

## üöÄ Motivation

Despite advancements in AI image generation, **no large language models (LLMs)** or image-generating models are currently capable of achieving perfect text placement in images like movie posters. Existing models often:
- Make **mistakes in text placement**, leading to poor visual aesthetics.
- Introduce **spelling or formatting errors** in the text.

Our project tackles these challenges by combining **state-of-the-art AI models** and a carefully curated training pipeline to develop a model that excels in:
1. Generating high-quality images.
2. Accurately placing text in unstructured, visually appealing ways.
3. Maintaining spelling and stylistic integrity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach

### 1. **üé• Image Generation**
We used the **[`black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev`](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)** model for **image generation**. This served as the foundation for creating visually stunning poster-like images.

### 2. **üîß Conditional Image Control**
To control the image parameters (such as resolution, strength, DDIM sampling, seed, etc.), we utilized the **[`lllyasviel/ControlNet`](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet)** framework. ControlNet ensures that AI understands the layout constraints required for text.

### 3. **üõ†Ô∏è Data Collection and Preprocessing**
We curated our dataset using the following steps:
- **Data Collection**: Extracted thousands of poster images from various sources and performed operations like removing outliers, null entries, and invalid images.
- **Caption Generation**: Captions were automatically generated for each image using the **[`vikhyatk/moondream2`](https://huggingface.co/vikhyatk/moondream2)** model, which provided detailed descriptions of the posters.
- **Conditional Images**: We generated lineart-style conditional images for each poster using the **[`lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1-nightly`](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1-nightly/blob/main/README.md#controlnet-11-lineart)** model. These conditional images guided the AI on text placement.

### Structure of the Dataset:
| **üñºÔ∏è Image**        | **‚úçÔ∏è Caption**                                                             | **üñäÔ∏è Conditional Image**     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Movie poster image   | A description of the poster, including characters, text, colors, etc.    | Lineart representation        |

- **Final Dataset**: You can view the dataset **[here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fhai50032/ControlNet-Poster)**.

### 4. **üß† Model Training**

We've successfully trained the model on a **small batch** of our dataset using an **NVIDIA A100 GPU**. While the model is not yet fully advanced (due to GPU limitations), it is capable of placing text within images with a basic level of aesthetic appeal.

## ‚ú® Generated Results
The model generated the following results based on early training:

```python
link = "https://csvtu.ac.in/ew/pics/DigiVarsity.png"
image = load_image(link)
control_image = processor(image)
controlnet_conditioning_scale = 0.65
width, height = control_image.size
prompt = "print a poster for a website with text 'DIGIVARSITY', make background as sunset mountain college"
image2 = pipe(
    prompt,
    control_image=control_image,
    control_mode=0,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    controlnet_conditioning_scale=controlnet_conditioning_scale,
    num_inference_steps=38,
    guidance_scale=3.2,
).images[0]
image2.save("image.jpg")
load_image("image.jpg")
```

![Output](test_imgs/output.png)  

### Observations:
1. **Text Placement**: The model has learned a basic level of text placement (but requires further refinement for complex layouts).
2. **Visual Appeal**: The generated images aligned with the prompts but need improvements in text styling and complexity.
3. **Next Focus**: Extended training and dataset expansion aimed to enhance output quality.

## üîÆ Next Steps
1. Train the model further using the full dataset for improved performance.
2. Fine-tune the model to handle unstructured text formats with greater precision.
3. Optimize for visually stunning and error-free text placement in generated images.
