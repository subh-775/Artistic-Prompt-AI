Brook and  writer Jean-Claude Carriere worked for eight years to develop this epic concerning two sides of a royal family, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, whose struggle leads to a fascinating voyage of emotions, passion and vision of glory. Briefly, the Mahabharata is a tale of two rival sets of brothers, cousins to eachother, each born into royalty and with divinely guided paths in life. The result, however, is a great war, death, destruction - a vast epic.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMzg5MjExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA0ODMyMQ@@._V1_UY268_CR3,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"

Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?,"In 1983 the upstart United States Football League (USFL) had the audacity to challenge the almighty NFL. The new league did the unthinkable by playing in the spring and plucked three straight Heisman Trophy winners away from the NFL. The 12-team USFL played before crowds that averaged 25,000, and started off with respectable TV ratings. But with success came expansion and new owners, including a certain high profile and impatient real estate baron whose vision was at odds with the leagueÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs founders. Soon, the USFL was reduced to waging a desperate anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL, which yielded an ironic verdict that effectively forced the league out of business. Now, almost a quarter of a century later, Academy Award-nominated and Peabody Award-winning director Mike Tollin, himself once a chronicler of the league, will showcase the remarkable influence of those three years on football history and attempt to answer the question, ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂWho Killed the USFL?ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgwMDY1OTMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE3MzU2Mw@@._V1_UY268_CR4,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"

The image of the predominantly white university was forever changed when coach Howard Schnellenberger scoured some of the toughest ghettos in Florida to recruit mostly black players for his team. With a newly branded swagger, inspired and fueled by the quickly growing local Miami hip hop culture, these Hurricanes took on larger-than-life personalities and won four national titles between 1983 and 1991. Filmmaker Billy Corben, a Miami native and University of Miami alum, will tell the story of how these ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂBad BoysÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ of football changed the attitude of the game they played, and how this serene campus was transformed into ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂThe U.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MDg3MjYyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAwNzU2Mw@@._V1_UY268_CR4,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"
Little Big Men,"In 1982, Cody Webster and a small group of friends from Kirkland, Washington, sat anxiously in a dugout waiting to take the field for the championship game of the Little League World Series. Their focus was just about what youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂd expect from any 12-year-old: hit the ball, throw strikes, cross your fingers and then maybe ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ maybe ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll win. Adults in the stands and watching from home saw a much broader field of play. The memories of American hostages and a crippling oil crisis were still fresh; the economic malaise of the late 1970s still lingered; and the new President was recovering from an assassination attempt even while confronting new threats from the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, back on that tiny baseball field in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, no American team had won a true international Little League World Series Championship in more than a decade. When the Kirkland players rushed from their dugout that day, they stepped onto a much bigger field than the one they saw.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NTQ2OTg5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk5MzIyMjE@._V1_UY268_CR87,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"
Unmatched,"The first time Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova stepped onto a tennis court together, the world scarcely noticed. Only a few hundred spectators saw the pert 18-year-old beat the scrappy 16-year-old Czech in 1973. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂI remember that she was fat,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Evert recalled. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂShe was very emotional on the court, whining if she didn't feel she was playing well. But I remember thinking, if she loses weight, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre all in trouble.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Said Navratilova, ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂMy goal was for her to remember my name.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Eighty matches later ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ amid the extraordinary growth of womenÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs tennis ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Evert not only remembered, but became a tried and true friend and confidante, remarkable considering the two appeared to be polar opposites in upbringing, life styles and personal relationships. Through a series of personal conversations, this documentary will tell the story of one of the greatest one-on-one sports rivalries and capture these two extraordinary athletesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ views on tennis and an ever-changing world.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMzQxNTY4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE4NTc5MjE@._V1_UY268_CR87,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"
Four Days in October,"When the night of October 16, 2004 came to a merciful end, the Curse of the Bambino was alive and well. The vaunted Yankee lineup, led by A-Rod, Jeter, and Sheffield, had just extended their ALCS lead to three games to none, pounding out 19 runs against their hated rivals. The next night, in Game 4, the Yankees took a 4-3 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning, then turned the game over to Mariano Rivera, the best relief pitcher in postseason history, to secure yet another trip to the World Series. But after a walk and a hard-fought stolen base, the cold October winds of change began to blow. Over four consecutive days and nights, this unlikely group of Red Sox miraculously won four straight games to overcome the inevitability of their destiny. Major League Baseball Productions will produce a film in ""real-time"" that takes an in-depth look at the 96 hours that brought salvation to Red Sox Nation and made baseball history in the process.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZkMWQyN2YtZjE2MC00M2YyLWFjYjQtNmZjOGI2MmFhODBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU1ODUxOTk@._V1_UY268_CR3,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"
Once Brothers,"Drazen Petrovic and Vlade Divac were two friends who grew up together sharing the common bond of basketball. Together, they lifted the Yugoslavian National team to unimaginable heights. After conquering Europe, they both went to USA where they became the first two foreign players to attain NBA stardom. But with the fall of the Soviet Union on Christmas Day 1991, Yugoslavia split up. A war broke out between Petrovic's Croatia and Divac's Serbia. Long buried ethnic tensions surfaced. And these two men, once brothers, were now on opposite sides of a deadly civil war. As Petrovic and Divac continued to face each other on the basketball courts of the NBA, no words passed between the two. Then, on the fateful night of June 7, 1993, Drazen Petrovic was killed in an auto accident. This film will tell the gripping tale of these men, how circumstances beyond their control tore them apart, and whether Divac has ever come to terms with the death of a friend before they had a chance to reconcile.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM1ZGMwMWMtZjJiMC00NjNmLWI2YzItZWZiZGM2NzYyNTFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ0MjM0MjQ@._V1_UY268_CR43,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"
Pony Excess,"From 1981-1984, a small private school in Dallas owned the best record in college football. The Mustangs of Southern Methodist University were riding high on the backs of the vaunted ""Pony Express"" backfield. But as the middle of the decade approached, the program was coming apart at the seams. Wins became the only thing that mattered as the University increasingly ceded power of the football program to the city's oil barons and real estate tycoons and flagrant and frequent NCAA violations became the norm. In 1987, the school and the sport were rocked, as the NCAA meted out ""the death penalty"" on a college football program for the first and only time in its history. SMU would be without football for two years, and the fan base would be without an identity for 20 more until the win in the 2009 Hawaii Bowl. This is the story of Dallas in the 1980's and the greed, power, and corruption that spilled from the oil fields onto the football field and all the way to the Governor's Mansion.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg0NDc2OTI3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTIyMjE@._V1_UY268_CR87,0,182,268_AL_.jpg"
